As a DevOps engineer, I successfully executed a project involving the deployment of Nginx on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance.
Utilizing my skills in cloud computing and version control, I achieved the following key accomplishments:
Employed Git to fork and pull the website's source code from the Git repository, ensuring efficient version control and streamlined deployment processes.
Configured Nginx to serve the hosted website and utilized the default settings as well as customized configurations for optimized performance.
Tested the website's accessibility and functionality through various browsers to ensure a smooth end-user experience.
Acquired valuable experience in setting up and managing AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances, security groups.
